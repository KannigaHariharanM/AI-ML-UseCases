# AI-ML-UseCases
This repository contains my Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning projects

* My latest project - Face Mask Segmentation - Built a deep learning model using U-Net architecture to locate the face in an image. Underlying model in U-net architecture is MobileNet, which is already trained on imagenet dataset. With Transfer learning, model's training were faster. In this project, simple U-net model achieved higher dice-coefficient than complex U-net models. 

* Street View Housing Number Digit Recognition using Fully connected Neural Networks. Image augmentation is used to eliminate noise in the image, which resulted in  better accuracy. 

* Predict the strength of concrete. Exploratory data analysis, Supervised learning, Unsupervised learning (Clustering), PCA, Polynomial features, Hyperparameter tuning (RandomizedSearchCV), Pipeline are leveraged in this project. Models are evaluated using RMSE and MAPE. 

* Amazon E-Commerce Product Recommender System - Two types of recommender systems are built in this project: 1) Popularity based and 2) User-User colloborative filtering using KNNWithMeans and Singular Value Decomposition(SVD). Evaluation metrics Root mean squared error(RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error(MAE) are impressive for SVD.  

* Predict the type of vehicle from different vehicle types. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used for dimensionality reduction. Achieved good accuracy with PCA and SVM.  

*	Predict whether a customer subscribe to Term Deposit using Ensemble technique. SMOTE is used for up-sampling to overcome the class imbalance issue with the input dataset. 

*	My first ML Project - Predict the likelihood of a customer buying Personal Loans using various Supervised Learning technique. Data visualizations are performed using bar chart, box plot and pair plot. Models are evaluated using Confusion matrix, Precision, Recall and F1 score.
